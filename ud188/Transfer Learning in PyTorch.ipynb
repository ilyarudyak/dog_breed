    "\n",
    "This project taught us the basics of using PyTorch and pretrained neural networks for image recognition. We saw how to take a network that was trained on a large set of images and apply it successfully to a different task. Along the way, we learned a number of useful concepts for working with cnns in PyTorch including how to get our data into a model. The end result is a capable model trained in far less time than one trained from starting weights. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the ideas covered in this notebook were:\n",
    "\n",
    "* PyTorch basics\n",
    "* Data transformations \n",
    "* Training data augmentation\n",
    "* Transfer Learning for object recognition\n",
    "* Training a PyTorch model with early stopping on a validation set\n",
    "* Inference using a PyTorch model\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Truly, we live in an incredible age for deep learning with the wide availability of resources, and it's only getting better! Hopefully, this notebook has prepared you to take on your own deep learning challenges with PyTorch. "
